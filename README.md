# [HowTheyVote.eu](https://howtheyvote.eu/) Tutorials

We provide tutorials on how to work with the HowTheyVote.eu [data set](https://github.com/howtheyVote/data).
These tutorials are oriented towards specific, common scenarios we and many users faced and aim at providing a blue-print to get started with our data set in an easy and accessible way.

We assume no prior knowledge about the data or the European Parliament. However, basic `python` knowledge and some amount of familiarity with `pandas` are required.

> [!NOTE]  
> We use [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For you, this means **zero setup** is required. Just click one of the links below and you are good to go. There is no need to install anything on your machine or download any data. You will be able to start immidiately, inside of a familiar Jupyter Notebook environment.
