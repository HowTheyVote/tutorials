Amendments that are either passed or rejected with a close margin are probable to have some amount of controversy about their contents. Identifying those can be a first step in finding interesting debates in Parliament.\n\nTo follow allong with the tutorial, you should already be familiar with data analysis in Python using `pandas`. You don’t need prior knowledge about the European Parliament.\n",

At different points in this process, committees and political groups of the Parliament can propose amendments to texts. Each amendment proposes one or many changes to the original document, either exchanging, removing, or adding content. The Plenary then votes on all amendments, either adopting or rejecting them.\n\nOnce the Plenary has decided on all amendments, it votes on the final wording of the text. If the majority approves the text, it becomes the official position of the European Parliament. If not, the text is rejected.",

Using the `votes` table, those can be identified quite fast, by finding all votes corresponding to a specific text and afterwards finding the narrowest of these decisions.\n\nWith this information in hand it is now possible to continue with substantive research on the specific amendments, or to take a look at which MEPs and groups voted which way.",
