        "\n",
        "We propose to define the groups position to be the position that most members of a group aligned with. For example, the group position of a group where 10 members voted in favor, 8 against and 3 abstained would be in favor.\n",

        "\n",

        "It is important to keep in mind that not all votes in the European Parliament are recorded in a way that allows to check how each individual MEP voted.\n",
        "Votes where this is possible are called roll-call votes. They are quite common in the European Parliament, but not ubiquitous. Naturally, for votes who are not taken by roll-call it is impossible for us (or anyone else) to know exactly which MEPs and groups voted similar.\n",

        "We will follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Find all votes which took place during the 10th term of Parliament and exclude some special cases like votes on the agenda.\n",
        "2. For each vote, construct a table in which we sum up the votes per group per position. This will result in a table where we have one row per vote-group-position combination, and the number of MEPs who voted that way.\n",
        "3. Using this table, we can find which position per vote was most common for members of each group - this is what we will call the group-line or group position.\n",
        "4. The tables up until now were in long format. We will construct a table in wide-format next, with a single row per vote and a column for each party, containing the group-line.\n",
        "5. Finally, we can compare the columns, allowing us to count how often the group-line between different groups was similar.\n",
