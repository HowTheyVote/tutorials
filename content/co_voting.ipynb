        "3. Using this table, we can find which position per vote was most common among MEPs of each group - this is the group position.\n",
        "4. We will then construct a table with only a single row per vote and a column per group containing the group position.\n",
        "5. Finally, we can compare the columns, allowing us to count how often two given groups shared the same group position.\n",
