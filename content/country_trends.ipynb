In general, we can see a lot of similar movements for both countries, which could indicate that many votes relate to both countries at once, for example [resolutions condemn this invasion itself](https://howtheyvote.eu/votes/165965). For most months, we also see more votes related to Ukraine than to Russia.\n\n## Further Analysis\n\nThis is of course only a very rudimentary analysis, but provides us with an interesting starting point. Some further investigations could include:\n\n- relationships between other countries\n- analyzing mentions per continent\n- analyzing mentions per type of text voted on (i.e., legislative or non-legislative)\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nIn this tutorial we have seen how we can leverage the `geo_area_votes` table of the HowTheyVote data set to identify which texts that Parliament voted on relate to which countries.
